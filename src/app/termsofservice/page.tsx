      <h3> What personal data we collect and why we collect it</h3>

      <h4>Comments </h4>
      <p>
        When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in
        the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user
        agent string to help spam detection. An anonymized string created from
        your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar
        service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy
        is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of
        your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the
        context of your comment. We do not collect your email address from the
        comments form for use in any email list, such as a newsletter or
        marketing email list. We also never sell email addresses to third
        parties.
